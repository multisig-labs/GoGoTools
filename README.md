<p align="center">A (growing) collection of useful tools for Avalanche subnet developers.</p>

GGT currently lets you quickly spin up a subnet dev environment that has avalanchego + subnet-evm + precompiles, allowing you to:

- Make your â€œTime to RPC" 10x faster
- Easily find/tweak/experiment with configs and precompiles
- Easily create many isolated environments to test different versions of binaries
- ... and comes with default user accounts / keys for easy startup

## Installation

Requires [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) version >= 1.20

Clone Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/multisig-labs/gogotools.git
cd gogotools
```

Install [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) for your system, something like:

```sh
brew install just
  or
cargo install just
  or
apk add just
  etc
```

Then build with

```sh
just build
```

which will create the binary `bin/ggt` (Make sure you add it to your $PATH)

## Usage

We are still trying to find the optimal workflows for doing this kind of dev work, but this is what we have as of now. Help wanted!

**Assumptions:**

- You have [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) installed and `cast` in your path
- You have a version of the `avalanchego` binary
- You have cloned the [subnet-evm](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm) repo and have a compiled evm binary
- You have this tool `ggt` compiled and in your $PATH

### Workflow

The idea is that we make a new, empty project directory, then use `ggt prepare` to create one or many `nodes`, which are basically a directory with `avalancego`, a vm binary, and a bunch of configs all setup in the right place. By default, `avalanchego` puts its files in `$HOME/.avalanchego`. **WE CHANGE THIS** behavior via command line flags to instead put all logs, db files, configs etc into the specified node directory, and organized a bit differently. The `start.sh` script starts up avalanchego with the correct command-line args.

You can easily blow away a node and start over with `rm -rf <dirname>`. If you want to save off your progress just `cp` the dir to a new name.

Once you have your node directory prepared, you can run it with `ggt node run <dirname>`. This will start up avalanchego in that directory. In this way its easy to have many directories, with say different binary versions of `avalanchego` and your vms, and switch between them. A caveat is that we expect only **ONE** node to be running at any one time.

If you have problems with the `ggt node run` command (it's currently under heavy development) you can always run the `start.sh` script inside each node directory to get things going.

### Example

```sh
# Mac
mkdir MySubnetProject
cd MySubnetProject
ggt utils init v1.10.19 v0.5.11 # Downloads binaries from GitHub
ggt node prepare NodeV1 --ava-bin=avalanchego-v1.10.19 --vm-name=subnetevm --vm-bin=subnet-evm-v0.5.11
```

If you then `prepared` another node NodeV2 with some different binary versions, you might have a directory structure that looks like this:

```
MySubnetProject
â”œâ”€â”€ NodeV1
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bin
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ avalanchego -> /path/to/avalanchego-v1.9.6
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ plugins

â”‚   â””â”€â”€ start.sh
â”œâ”€â”€ NodeV2
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ bin
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ avalanchego -> /path/to/avalanchego-v1.9.7
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ plugins
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ srEXiWaHuhNyGwPUi444Tu47ZEDwxTWrbQiuD7FmgSAQ6X7Dy -> /path/to/subnetevm-v0.4.8
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ configs
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ chains
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ C
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.json
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ X
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.json
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ aliases.json
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ node-config.json
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ vms
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ aliases.json
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ start.sh
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ accounts.json
â”œâ”€â”€ contracts.json
â”œâ”€â”€ evmconfig.json
â”œâ”€â”€ node-config.json
â”œâ”€â”€ subnetevm-config.json
â””â”€â”€ subnetevm-genesis.json
```

(Note that the `--vm-name=subnetevm` name you supplied for your VM (which can be any name) has been converted into an Avalanche `ids.ID` `srEXiWaHuhNyGwPUi444Tu47ZEDwxTWrbQiuD7FmgSAQ6X7Dy` and symlinked to the vm binary you specified)

Now we can start our node:

```sh
ggt node run NodeV1 (--clear-logs to delete logs before starting node)
```

This will start `avalanchego` from the `NodeV1` directory and you should see the `NodeV1/data` directory fill up with logs and data.

In another terminal, lets create our subnet (the `ggt utils init` cmd we ran earlier creates a sample genesis with all precompiles enabled):

```sh
ggt wallet create-chain NodeV1 MyChain subnetevm subnetevm-genesis.json
```

This command assumes NodeV1 is running, and will create a new Subnet, and then inside that subnet it will create a blockchain with the name `MyChain`, using the `subnetevm` virtual machine binary we registered earlier, and using the specified genesis file.

You should see an RPC URL printed to the terminal:

`http://localhost:9650/ext/bc/6SPgMtm5xfZrGGLJztaByMwKGJhrw4WzhKk6nGC5yfXqiJGuT/rpc`

You can now use this to issue commands to your EVM.

## Info

```sh
ggt node info | jq
```

(Assuming you have [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) installed, and why wouldn't you!)

This collects node info from several different Avalanche API endpoints and gives you a single blob with all the data, including an `rpcs` key with the rpc url for each blockchain.

  }
}
```

This makes it easy to do something like this:

```sh
export ETH_RPC_URL=`ggt node info | jq -r '.rpcs.MyChain'`
cast chain-id
```

## Block Explorer

Once you have your node running, you can pop up a browser with the [Expedition](https://github.com/xops/expedition) blockchain explorer pointed at your node.

```sh
ggt node explorer MyChain
```

## Subnet EVM Precompiles

The [Subnet-EVM](https://github.com/ava-labs/subnet-evm) repo has some nice example contracts you can use to interact with the default subnetevm and precompiles.

However, in the interest of getting as close to the metal as possible, to really understand how things are working, `ggt` has some convenience commands that wrap the (amazing!) `cast` command from Foundry. The `ggt utils init` command creates default `accounts.json` and `contracts.json` files, that you can modify with your particular info, and we use these to make issuing `cast` commands a little more ergonomic by using those files to resolve user and contract addresses. Out of the box they come with a few users and all the default precompile contract addresses.

Assuming you have your node running, and your `ETH_RPC_URL` pointing to it, you can do things like this:

```sh
# Balances of users in accounts.json
ggt cast balances | jq
# Send eth from one user to another
ggt cast send-eth owner alice 1ether | jq
# Call read-only contract methods
ggt cast call owner TxAllowList "readAllowList(address)" bob
ggt cast call owner FeeConfigManager "getFeeConfigLastChangedAt()"
# Send a signed tx to a contract / method
ggt cast send owner NativeMinter "mintNativeCoin(address,uint256)" alice 1ether | jq
ggt cast send owner TxAllowList "setEnabled(address)" bob | jq
ggt cast send owner TxAllowList "setNone(address)" bob | jq
```

Cast has tools to decode the output of a contract call, so for example to see the current fee configuration via the precompile we can do this:

```sh
export DATA=$(ggt cast call owner FeeConfigManager "getFeeConfig()")
cast --abi-decode "getFeeConfig()(uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256)" $DATA

8000000
2
25000000000
50000000
36
0
1000000
200000
```

Which maps to the struct returned by the precompile

```sol
function getFeeConfig()
    external
    view
    returns (
      uint256 gasLimit,
      uint256 targetBlockRate,
      uint256 minBaseFee,
      uint256 targetGas,
      uint256 baseFeeChangeDenominator,
      uint256 minBlockGasCost,
      uint256 maxBlockGasCost,
      uint256 blockGasCostStep
    );
```

This is version 0.01 of this tool, and we plan on making it so useful that it will be a core part of every Avalanche developer's toolbox. We welcome any and all idea / contributions on how to make the experience better.
